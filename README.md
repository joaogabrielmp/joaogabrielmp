### Hi there 🤙

My name is João Gabriel from Brazil (🇧🇷). 
 
I really like the Javascript stack. Like NodeJS, ReactJS, React Native and Typescript too. 

In my free time I like 
 - to play soccer (⚽️)
 - to watch different sports (🏀 🏈 🛹 🏎)
 - to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺)
 - to read books (📚)
 - to listen to music (🎵).
 - And especially, going to church to worship God (🙌)(†).

Would you like to find me?
